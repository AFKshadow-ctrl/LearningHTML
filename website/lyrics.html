  <p>
    Hello, is it me you're looking for?<br>
    I can see it in your eyes <br>
    I can see it in your smile <br>
    You're all I've ever wanted <br>
    And my arms are open wide <br>
    'Cause you know just what to say <br>
    And you know just what to do <br>
    And I want to tell you so much <br>
    I love you
  </p>

  <h2>
    second
  </h2>
  <br>
  <pre>
    I long to see the sunlight in your hair 
    And tell you time and time again 

    How much I care 
    'Cause I know 
    How it feels 
    When you are lost 
    And you're alone 

    And you're searching for a friend 
    To carry you home
  </pre>
